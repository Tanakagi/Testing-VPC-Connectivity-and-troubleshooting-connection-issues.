## End of project.

<b>This was the end of my project as I was able to successfully:</br>
<b>• Create a VPC and secure it using network ACLs and Security groups,</br>
<b>• Launch 2 EC2 instances in a private and public subnet that could communicate with each other,</br>
<b>• Successfully troubleshoot connectivity issues and connect to the internet via my public server.</br>
