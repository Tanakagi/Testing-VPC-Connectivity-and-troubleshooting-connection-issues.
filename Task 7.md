# Task 7: Testing VPC connectivity with the internet.

<b>I entered a curl command to test the public servers' connectivity with the internet.</br>
<b>•This output confirms that my Public Sever instance can talk with the internet.</br>
<b>• Tand that my Public Subnet, internet gateway and security settings were set up properly.</br>

<b>• I then ran a different curl command this command sends an HTTP request to the server that hosts the website.</br>

## End of project.

<b>This was the end of my project as I was able to successfully:</br>
<b>• Create a VPC and secure it using network ACLs and Security groups,</br>
<b>• Launch 2 EC2 instances in a private and public subnet that could communicate with each other,</br>
<b>• Successfully troubleshoot connectivity issues and connect to the internet via my public server.</br>
