# Testing-VPC-Connectivity-and-troubleshooting-connection-issues.

In this project, I created a secure VPC where I launched 2 EC2 instances in a private and public subnet. I then tested connectivity and troubleshoot issues with connectivity using the EC2 instances.

## AWS services used:
<b> **• Amazon VPC and subnets** - used to create a network.</br>
<b> **• Amazon  route tables** - used to route network traffic within the VPC.</br>
<b> **• Network Access Control List** - used to secure the network and control network traffic.</br>
<b> **• Internet Gateway** - used to provide internet access to the public EC2 Instance.</br>
<b> **• NAT Gateway** - used to control and secure network routing.</br>
<b> **• Amazon EC2** - used to test connectivity.</br>
<b> **• A security group** - used to control and secure EC2 Instances.</br>
</br>

<b>**Project infrastructure**</br>
